= Interacting with a SQL database

Groovy's `groovy-sql` module provides a higher-level abstraction over Java's JDBC technology. JDBC itself provides
a lower-level but fairly comprehensive API which provides uniform access to a whole variety of supported relational database systems.
We'll use HSQLDB in our examples here but you can alternatively use Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL and a host of others.
The most frequently used class within the `groovy-sql` module is the `groovy.sql.Sql` class which raises the JDBC
abstractions up one level. We'll cover that first.

== Connecting to the database

Connecting to a database with Groovy's `Sql` class requires four pieces of information:

* The database uniform resource locator (URL)
* Username
* Password
* The driver class name (which can be derived automatically in some situations)

For our HSQLDB database, the values will be something like that shown in the following table:

[cols="1,1" options="header"]
|====
| Property
| Value

| url
| `jdbc:hsqldb:mem:yourdb`

| user
| sa (or your _username_)

| password
| _yourPassword_

| driver
| `org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver`
|====

Consult the documentation for the JDBC driver that you plan to use to determine the correct values for your situation.

The `Sql` class has a `newInstance` factory method which takes these parameters. You would typically use it as follows:

[source,groovy]
.Connecting to HSQLDB
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_connecting,indent=0]
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_connecting_close,indent=0]
----

If you don't want to have to handle resource handling yourself (i.e. call `close()` manually) then you can use the `withInstance` variation as shown here:

[source,groovy]
.Connecting to HSQLDB (`withInstance` variation)
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_withInstance_p1,indent=0]
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_withInstance_p2,indent=0]
----

=== Connecting with a DataSource

It is often preferred to use a DataSource. You may have one available to you from a connection pool.
Here we'll use the one provided as part of the HSQLDB driver jar as shown here:

[source,groovy]
.Connecting to HSQLDB with a DataSource
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_connecting_datasource,indent=0]
----

If you have your own connection pooling, the details will be different, e.g. for Apache Commons DBCP:

[source,groovy]
.Connecting to HSQLDB with a DataSource using Apache Commons DBCP
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_connecting_datasource_dbcp,indent=0]
----

=== Connecting using @Grab

The previous examples assume that the necessary database driver jar is already on your classpath.
For a self-contained script you can add `@Grab` statements to the top of the script to automatically download the necessary jar as shown here:

[source,groovy]
.Connecting to HSQLDB using @Grab
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_connecting_grab,indent=0]
----

The `@GrabConfig` statement is necessary to make sure the system classloader is used. This ensures that the driver classes and
system classes like `java.sql.DriverManager` are in the same classloader.

== Executing SQL

You can execute arbitrary SQL commands using the `execute()` method. Let's have a look at using it to create a table.

=== Creating tables

The simplest way to execute SQL is to call the `execute()` method passing the SQL you wish to execute as a String as shown here:

[source,groovy]
.Creating a table
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_creating_table,indent=0]
----

There is a variant of this method which takes a GString and another with a list of parameters. There are also other variants with similar names: `executeInsert` and `executeUpdate`.
We'll see examples of these variants in other examples in this section.

== Basic CRUD operations

The basic operations on a database are Create, Read, Update and Delete (the so-called CRUD operations). We'll examine each of these in turn.

=== Creating/Inserting data

You can use the same `execute()` statement we saw earlier but to insert a row by using a SQL insert statement as follows:

[source,groovy]
.Inserting a row
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_inserting_row,indent=0]
----

You can use a special `executeInsert` method instead of `execute`. This will return a list of all keys generated.
Both the `execute` and `executeInsert` methods allow you to place '?' placeholders into your SQL string and supply a list of parameters.
In this case a PreparedStatement is used which avoids any risk of SQL injection. The following example illustrates `executeInsert` using placeholders and parameters:

[source,groovy]
.Inserting a row using executeInsert with placeholders and parameters
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_inserting_row_executeInsert,indent=0]
----

In addition, both the `execute` and `executeInsert` methods allow you to use GStrings. Any '$' placeholders within the SQL are assumed
to be placeholders. An escaping mechanism exists if you want to supply part of the GString with a variable in a
position which isn't where normal placeholders go within SQL. See the GroovyDoc for more details.
Also, `executeInsert` allows you to supply a list of key column names, when multiple keys are returned and you are only interested in some of them.
 Here is a fragment illustrating key name specification and GStrings:

[source,groovy]
.Inserting a row using executeInsert with a GString and specifying key names
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_inserting_row_executeInsert_keys,indent=0]
----

=== Reading rows

Reading rows of data from the database is accomplished using one of several available methods: `query`, `eachRow`, `firstRow` and `rows`.

Use the `query` method if you want to iterate through the `ResultSet` returned by the underlying JDBC API as shown here:

[source,groovy]
.Reading data using `query`
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_reading_query,indent=0]
----

Use the `eachRow` method if you want if you want a slightly higher-level abstraction which provides a Groovy friendly map-like abstraction for the `ResultSet` as shown here:

[source,groovy]
.Reading data using `eachRow`
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_reading_eachrow,indent=0]
----

Note that you can use Groovy list-style and map-style notations when accessing the row of data.

Use the `firstRow` method if you for similar functionality as `eachRow` but returning only one row of data as shown here:

[source,groovy]
.Reading data using `firstRow`
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_reading_firstrow,indent=0]
----

Use the `rows` method if you want to process a list of map-like data structures as shown here:

[source,groovy]
.Reading data using `rows`
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_reading_rows,indent=0]
----

Note that the map-like abstraction has case-insensitive keys (hence we can use 'FIRSTNAME' or 'firstname' as the key) and
also that -ve indices (a standard Groovy feature) works when using an index value (to count column numbers from the right).

You can also use any of the above methods to return scalar values, though typically `firstRow` is all that is required in such cases. An example returning the count of rows is shown here:

[source,groovy]
.Reading scalar values
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_reading_scalar,indent=0]
----

=== Updating rows

Updating rows can again be done using the `execute()` method. Just use a SQL update statement as the argument to the method.
You can insert an author with just a lastname and then update the row to also have a firstname as follows:

[source,groovy]
.Updating a row
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_updating_execute,indent=0]
----

There is also a special `executeUpdate` variant which returns the number of rows updated as a result of executing the SQL.
For example, you can change the lastname of an author as follows:

[source,groovy]
.Using executeUpdate
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_updating_execute_update,indent=0]
----

=== Deleting rows

The `execute` method is also used for deleting rows as this example shows:

[source,groovy]
.Deleting rows
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-sql/src/spec/test/SqlTest.groovy[tags=sql_deleting_data,indent=0]
----
